                        <hr>
                        <!-- <img src=""> -->
                        <p>The fight to end Black Out in Africa is on! You want to help clean the environment, stem global warming, strengthen the energy grid, support national security and energy independence, while you also become energy independent yourself and hedge against rising power and maintenance costs with a fixed-price rental contract, then sign up now to FREE YOURSELF!</p>
                        <p>At GosolarAfrica for Climate Credit Network, our mission is to spread the use of clean, renewable solar power and technologies as simply and as rapidly as possible. That's why we've done everything possible to eliminate obstacles to both buying the solar power, and becoming an ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The simplest way we have designed this is to model our program after the United Nations Kyoto Protocol Carbon Credit methodology. Under this protocol, Organization, businesses and individuals from the developing nations can earn unlimited carbon credit for implementing renewable projects and also on other activities that limits the release of carbon (CO2) and Green house gasses to the atmosphere. (Read more about how U.N Carbon Trading market works on our website).</p>
                        <p>With an expected mid-term carbon offset advanced investment earned from CarbonCredit Network Green market place within the next 6 months for about 45,000 Metric Tons CO2, GoSolarAfrica shall be able to deploy its first 15,000 SHS for residential customers after fulfilling all conditions under the Solar Rental Agreement. With much anticipation, millions of businesses and entrepreneurs have waited for a simple way or platform to tap into the United Nations carbon finance mechanism; CarbonCredit Network will offer the 1st most friendly way to build wealth through this as climate change problem itself is a good business!</p>
                        <p>Our program entails no up-front costs or fees, unlike several other direct selling organizations; but we do demand that you invest time in educating yourself and in turn educating the consumer about renewable energy, most specifically, PV-generated electricity.</p>
                        <p>Climate Credit Network pays for, installs, owns and operates the Solar Home System (SHS). All you do is pay for your monthly electricity usage from your panels. Your contract rate for this electricity is based on the outcome of your energy audit + your average carbon footprint for your utility during the prior year. We lock in? this rate so that it never goes up for the entire duration of the contract, up to 10 years. We give you back your power, you produce your own electricity, and you keep the savings every month.</p>
                        <p>Here are some of the benefits you receive:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>No upfront equipment investment</li>
                                <li>No waiting for discount or solar to become cheaper</li>
                                <li>Climate Credit Network obtains all permits and handles engineering, procurement, and construction.</li>
                                <li>You only pay for what is delivered. Since the solar power you generate reduces your need for energy from your utility company, generator or PHCN, your net payment will be equal to, or less than, what you are paying now.</li>
                                <li>Hassle-free operating and maintenance</li>
                                <li>Hedge against future PHCN or fuel price increases; we lock-in your electricity rates from the solar system for up to 10 years</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><i>After you sign up for a no obligation account on our Climate Credit Network website (or ask the person who referred you to our website), an optional account activation is require if you ever want to earn Carbon Credit on the savings from your Solar Home System (SHS), a demonstration that you are a Carbon Neutral Citizen (You get a Green Label Certificate ? It comes with a Lapel badge and car sticker or door sticker, a customized logo badge to be used on your company website.</i></p>
                        <p>If you decide then to install the SHS, you pay a security deposit, which you will receive back with interest at the end of the contract period. You will also receive a Solar Rental Agreement (SRA) to sign, with the terms for your Solar Home System (SHS). When Climate Credit Network is ready to install your panels, an engineer comes to you to design the actual system requirement under our offering (1KVA, 2KVA and 3KVA)</p>
                        <p>Your rent for a SHS is based on the size of your system and how much power it generates. Since the fuel supply (sunlight) is free and very little maintenance is required throughout its lifetime of about 50 years, Climate Credit Network rents to you at a fixed pre determined rate for the contract period you sign up for one, or 10 years. Your SHS rate is ?locked in? at the time of signing an SRA.</p>
                        <p>Gosolar Africa engineers design a SHS system that will meet your exact needs based on your electricity usage, obtains the permits, procures the equipment, installs the system, and integrates it with your other energy sources at home (Utility Company, Generators or PHCN).</p>
                        <p>Gosolar Africa monitors your SHS electronically to make sure it performs at its optimum capability. We have a vested interest with the performance of your SHS. If it doesn't generate electricity, you pay nothing!</p>
                        <p>At the end of each month, Climate Credit Network will provide you with a bill that tells you how much electricity your SHS has generated. Your rent is equal to your contract rate times the electricity generated. The Climate Credit Network and GoSolarAfrica has designed a business that delivers the SHS to you under the best possible conditions. Climate Credit Network uses only the best grade components to make up the SHS. It is professionally installed and maintained by our team of dedicated engineers and technicians. And with a performance-based rental contract, you receive the strongest form of system warranty available.</p>
                        <p>You need NOT be concerned with:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Potential system failure</li>
                                <li>Warranty assurance from equipment providers</li>
                                <li>Whether your choice to switch to solar power was right or not, since you don?t have to make a large technology investment</li>
                                <li>Through the SHS program you are virtually able to eliminate your risk in adopting solar power.</li>

                        <hr>
                        <h4>Health</h4>
                        <p>The KIKE Green Cook is great and a high-performing stove. It provides a significant health benefit to families otherwise dependent on dirty - solid fuels - kerosene, wood, dung, crop residues, charcoal, even coal - by eliminating dangerous smoke and gases from the home. Millions of families around the world are still dependent on these fuels and millions die yearly, mostly women and children, as a result of cooking smoke and other harmful gases.</p>

                        <h4>User-friendly & safe</h4>
                        <p>The KIKE Green Cook not only burns cleanly but is extremely safe to use. The Gel house is non-pressurized and holds Biogel in a special controlled jelly canister so you don't need to be bothered about spill or being turned over. The burner flame is adjusted and extinguished by a simple regulator (shown). This stove was developed to address the many safety concerns presented by other stoves and have been rated #1.</p>

                        <h4>Durable</h4>
                        <p>All KIKE Green Cook are of durable design. The KD-series is made entirely of long-lasting special baked stainless steel. An expensive improvement on the AS-series is made with cost-saving but durable substitutes - galvanized steel and aluminium. All burner parts are high temperature stainless steel. The flame regulator is the only moving part.</p>

                        <h4>Environmentally friendly</h4>
                        <p>Cooking with Biofuel from sustainably produced energy crops reduces wood use and deforestation. The KIKE Green Cook dramatically reduces greenhouse gas and soot (black carbon) emissions. This means a greatly reduced Global Warming Impact.</p>

                        <h4>KIKE Green Cook KD1 / KD2: DATA SHEET</h4>
                        <p>The KIKE Green Cook stove has been successfully tested in households of all income levels in Kumasi and Accra's capital city, Ghana and widely used in Nigeria. It has undergone trials in Brazil, South Africa and Kenya. It has been introduced by the Global Alliance for Clean Cook Stoves and adopted by many Governments as the preferred stove in many countries and has been tested in others. The KIKE Green Cook has now logged two million stove-use-days with an unparalleled safety and performance record.</p>
                        <p>KIKE Green Cook is the chosen stove for West African Women Association of ECOWAS (WAWA) and have been endorsed by UNDP and Bank of Industry (BOI) under the Access to Renewable Energy Facility Project. Was exhibited at the Governor's Pavilion at the Rio +20 Earth Summit in Rio de janeiro where the Nigerian President (Dr. Goodluck Jonathan) received it with Excitement.</p>
                        <p>All stainless steel burner parts, body of stainless steel (M1/M2), galvanized steel, high quality enamel finish or aluminium (KD1/KD2).<br>0.75 liter of Gel fuel (Two filling) will provide a full day of cooking for a family of five. Successfully tested in homes in Ghana, Brazil, South Africa, Ethiopia, Nigeria and elsewhere. The KIKE Green Cook stove is based on tried and true technology in use in Asia, Europe and America for 30 years.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">Energy LED Bulbs</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p><b>Long-lasting</b> - LED bulbs last up to 10 times as long as compact fluorescents, and far longer than typical incandescents.</p>
                        <p><b>Durable</b> - since LEDs do not have a filament, they are not damaged under circumstances when a regular incandescent bulb would be broken. Because they are solid, LED bulbs hold up well to jarring and bumping.</p>
                        <p><b>Cool</b> - these bulbs do not cause heat build-up; LEDs produce 3.4 btu's/hour, compared to 85 for incandescent bulbs. Common incandescent bulbs get hot and contribute to heat build-up in a room. LEDs prevent this heat build-up, thereby helping to reduce air conditioning costs in the home.</p>
                        <p><b>Mercury-free</b> - no mercury is used in the manufacturing of LEDs.</p>
                        <p><b>More efficient</b> - LED light bulbs use only 2-17 watts of electricity (1/3rd to 1/30th of Incandescent or CFL). LED bulbs used in fixtures inside the home save electricity, remain cool and save money on replacement costs since LED bulbs last so long. Small LED flashlight bulbs will extend battery life 10 to 15 times longer than with incandescent bulbs.</p>
                        <p><b>Cost-effective</b> - although LEDs are initially expensive, the cost is recouped over time and in battery savings. LED bulb use was first adopted commercially, where maintenance and replacement costs are expensive. But the cost of new LED bulbs has gone down considerably in the last few years and are continuing to go down. Today, there are many new LED light bulbs for use in the home, and the cost is becoming less of an issue. To see a cost comparison between the different types of energy-saving light bulbs, see our Light Bulb Comparison Charts.</p>
                        <p><b>Light for remote areas and portable generators</b> - because of the low power requirement for LEDs, using solar panels becomes more practical and less expensive than running an electric line or using a generator for lighting in remote or off-grid areas. LED light bulbs are also ideal for use with small portable generators which homeowners use for backup power in emergencies.</p>
