            <p>The Climate Credit Network (CCN) is the Africa's 1st Carbon trading platform to remove the barriers to widespread and adoption of renewable energies, clean technologies and wealth creation patterned after the United Nations Kyoto Protocol Carbon finance mechanism. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="readmore active" onclick="$('.ccnmore').removeClass('hidden'); $(this).hide();">Read more</a></p>
            <div class="ccnmore hidden">
                <p>It's a Multi-Stakeholder participatory foundation originated from Africa, designed and formed by highest ranking Green companies, professionals, social investors, private clubs and Governments.</p>
                <p>The Climate Credit Network is a worldwide, private, members-only association dedicated to helping members create wealth, generate large monthly residual incomes, fight climate change, improve emotional well-being, increase access to energy , electricity and achieve dynamic, vibrant health.</p>
                <p>The Climate Credit Network was the brainchild of over 500 extremely wealthy people from around the world who are current renegade and maverick board members of some of the world's most private, elite, and privilege clubs, organizations, groups, networks or Governments.</p>
                <p>The individuals who conceived and helped organize the Climate Credit Network (The CCN Trustees) are, and will always remain a myth. These men and women was created by the old rule (Brown economy) and they are helping to create a new order (Green Economy). The wealth of the world is only reserved for the very few elite within a particular cartel and clubs. For the first time in human history, the highest ranking members of these exclusive groups have encouraged the formation of a new, private, member only group. A group that allows people who do not qualify to become members of the above listed top-notch organizations to join together, and be exposed to the same exclusive revealed and taught to members of those group and clubs.</p>
                <p>Now, we are creating a new World Order that is presented to close the gap between the wealthy and the average working man. CCN does not agree with this movement of total control over individuals. CCN believes that EVERY person has the right to know the power of creating the life they want and enjoy freedom, pursue happiness, and achieve all their dreams and desires.</p>

                <h4>JOIN THE CLIMATE CREDIT NETWORK</h4>
                <p>This is your personal private invitation to become a member of one of the world's most exclusive private wealth-building organizations.

                <p><i>Membership is not for everyone and may not be for you.</i><br> <b>"Please take the time to review all the information on the Climate Credit Network website to get all the facts and particulars, and then decide if you would like to submit a new member application and be considered for membership. Not all applications will be accepted and not everyone qualifies."</b></p>
                
                <h4>OPPORTUNITIES</h4>
                <p>If you would like to have the opportunity to have some of the most successful people in the world personally help you achieve financial freedom, please pay close attention to this invitation and what is being offered to you right now. If you have goals and dreams, membership in the Climate Credit Network can help you make those dreams turn into a reality.</p>
                <p>The so called secret societies or private clubs have been around for centuries. Today secret societies are not so secret. Most people have heard of the Ogboni fraternity, Yale University's Skull and Bones, Chamber of Commerce, Club 50, World Economic group, the Brotherhood, Oil Block Barons (OBB), Member of the order of Niger (OON), the Free Masons, the Illuminati, the Ikoyi Club, the Young Presidents Organization, or the Council of Foreign Relations. There are virtually dozens of these types of private groups, clubs, associations, and such networks all around the world.</p>
                <p>Up until now, membership in these exclusive clubs has been limited to the privileged elite class, members of royalty, and the super wealthy. Those who were lucky enough to be members in these private organizations were given insider, advanced, privilege knowledge on how to have, be, or do everything they wanted. Members were given access to networking and opportunities with other affluent, powerful and prominent members and had a members helping other members promise made to one another. Members were given first option and advance knowledge on business, investments, and money making opportunities that the average person never had access to.</p>
                <p>These individuals occupy the highest positions in the Government, they sit on board of multinationals, they are revered and consulted before any bill or law is passed, they own the biggest yatch clubs, cars and high rise buildings, they own their own bank and print money at will – they have unfair advantage over others because of their membership!</p>
                <p>Now you are being given the same opportunity that up until now has been reserved for the privileged elite class, the super wealthy and powerful, well connected families.</p>
                <p>You too can be powerful, Wealth can be yours. You can build your own refinery without Government license. Emotional well-being can be yours. Financial freedom is within your reach. Dynamic, vibrant health and prosperity for you is now at hand. <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$('.ccnmore').addClass('hidden'); $('.readmore').show();">Hide</a></p>

                        <p>Training is paramount to our organization because we are active in an infantile market that is dealing with new and disruptive technology. We demand of our representatives intimate knowledge of the Renewable Energy industry, solar energy space, Biofuel and Energy Efficiency. We don't ask that you become an electrical engineer or technician, but we do ask that you understand the difference between fossil fuels and renewable fuels and that you understand ways to save energy, how clean-non polluting cook stove works, what solar fitila can do for low income households, how solar power works, and how solar power benefits us in so many ways.</p>
                        <p>We believe that if you are properly trained in this knowledge that you will have the ability and the confidence to pass on that knowledge to the consumer and effectively switch the consumer - knocking down all barriers to the consumer. As you progress in the Organization, you must also take qualifying training to become a green officer, manager and green director.</p>
                        <p>These are obviously successively harder as they cover additional material. But each of the training is designed to equip you with the best knowledge possible for fulfilling your duties successfully.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the initial tests, we also require market place entrepreneurs, managers, and directors to fulfill an annual training. Several training tools are available to you to assist you in passing your tests and to help you to continually build your knowledge of the renewable energy industry and the easiest methods of making a sell.</p>
                        <p>We stress training and supplying you with the right training tools because we believe knowledge is critical: accurate knowledge breaks down barriers. So, if you have any suggestions for improving our training program and training tools, please feel free to do so.</p>
